 * OfferShippingDetails represents information about shipping destinations.

 * Multiple of these entities can be used to represent different shipping rates for different destinations:
 * 
 * One entity for Alaska/Hawaii. A different one for continental US.A different one for all France.

 * Multiple of these entities can be used to represent different shipping costs and delivery times.
 * 
 * Two entities that are identical but differ in rate and time:
 * 
 * e.g. Cheaper and slower: $5 in 5-7days
 * or Fast and expensive: $15 in 1-2 days.
