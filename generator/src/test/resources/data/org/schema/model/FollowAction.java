/**
 * The act of forming a personal connection with someone/something (object) unidirectionally/asymmetrically to get updates polled from.<br/><br/>Related actions:<br/><br/>* [[BefriendAction]]: Unlike BefriendAction, FollowAction implies that the connection is *not* necessarily reciprocal.<br/>* [[SubscribeAction]]: Unlike SubscribeAction, FollowAction implies that the follower acts as an active agent constantly/actively polling for updates.<br/>* [[RegisterAction]]: Unlike RegisterAction, FollowAction implies that the agent is interested in continuing receiving updates from the object.<br/>* [[JoinAction]]: Unlike JoinAction, FollowAction implies that the agent is interested in getting updates from the object.<br/>* [[TrackAction]]: Unlike TrackAction, FollowAction refers to the polling of updates of all aspects of animate objects rather than the location of inanimate objects (e.g. you track a package, but you don't follow it).
