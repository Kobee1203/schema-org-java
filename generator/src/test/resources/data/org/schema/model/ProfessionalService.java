 *         [[AccountingService]], [[Attorney]], [[Notary]], as well as types for several kinds of [[HomeAndConstructionBusiness]]: [[Electrician]], [[GeneralContractor]],
 *         [[HousePainter]], [[Locksmith]], [[Plumber]], [[RoofingContractor]]. [[LegalService]] was introduced as a more inclusive supertype of [[Attorney]].
