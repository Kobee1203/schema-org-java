/**
 * A CovidTestingFacility is a [[MedicalClinic]] where testing for the COVID-19 Coronavirus
 *       disease is available. If the facility is being made available from an established [[Pharmacy]], [[Hotel]], or other
 *       non-medical organization, multiple types can be listed. This makes it easier to re-use existing schema.org information
 *       about that place, e.g. contact info, address, opening hours. Note that in an emergency, such information may not always be reliable.
 *
